Plant Factory - Environment Management
New Agriculture Style
Smart & Sustanable

Due to the population increasing, it is said that a food crisis will occur throughout the world within the near future. In Ireland, a country which relies on importing most of its food, vegetable and fruit farming is not the thriving industry that it is in other countries due to problems with weather and soil. food can be grown anywhere by hydroponics or film cultivation. Plant factories are easier to manage using technology, so we can counter any atypical growing environment to cultivate efficient and clean farming.

Environmental Management with IoT
The environmental control system requires using cameras to monitor and record multiple growth factors such as temperature, humidity, light. Timers indicate when to open and close pipe valves.

Overview
ðŸŒ± temp_humid.py:

To Run type in the command: python3 temp_humid.py

(1) Get temperature and humidity with Sense Hat and communicate with Blynk.

(2) If the temperature is above or below the set temperature, send a logEvent request with a code of either temp_too_high or temp_too_low to the Blynk server. Similarly, if the humidity is above or below the configured humidity, it will send a logEvent request with either the code humidity_too_high or humidity_too_low to the Blynk server. This will notify you via popup and email in the Blynk application.

ðŸŒ± schedule_pi.py:

To Run type in the command: python3 schedule_pi.py

It schedules light lighting and light color switch schedule, feeding time alarm, and image capture.

(1) The LED light of the sense hat is set with the python schedule library that it lights up in red or green at a set time.

(2) Capture an image at a set time and automatically save it to Firebase storage using the storeFileFB.py function. During image capture, turn off the lights (there is a white setting if it's dark) and save a color correct photo for color recognition.

(3) Send an HTTP GET request to the URL and send a log event to the API endpoint using Python's requests library to notify the feeding time of water etc. Blynk's Event settings will send push notifications and emails.

ðŸŒ± storeFileFB.py

Upload files to Google Cloud Storage and push filenames to Realtime Database

ðŸŒ± streaming.py

To Run type in the command: python3 streaming.py

Using Python's subprocess module to run the streaming.sh script

ðŸŒ± streaming.sh

A script that uses ffmpeg commands to start YouTube Live streaming. If don't use streaming.py, able to run with ./streaming.sh

ðŸŒ± colour_detect.py

To Run type in the command: python3 colour_detect.py

Recognition of harvest time (e.g. if tomato became red)

Send a notification to Blynk if a red color in the latest image.

ðŸŒ± Web hosting
